#### A start-up is a young company that has developed a unique business idea, aims to make an instant impact, and take over the market. Either thinking about an investor, a service provider or a candidate perspective, is interesting to understand if the startup will succeed or not and be aware of the risks and potential growth ahead of the market.


### Objective

The objective is to predict whether a startup which is currently operating turns into a success or a failure. The success of a company is defined as the event that gives the company's founders a large sum of money through the process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). A company would be considered as failed if it had to be shut down.


### Conclusions and Next Steps

- Best model to predict the success was Random Forest and Decision Tree.
- According to the feature importance score the model identified acquired, relationship and age of last milestone as more valuable.
- When we identify what values could be relationship we identify different causes, the next step would be to separate those relationships into features for example accounts, mentors, vendors etc, to try understand if they have more impact separately.
- Another point that is possible to consider is add features into what is a success start-up, for example besides acquired or to be in the top500, to have had the first milestone within the first 2 years for example.
